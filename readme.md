# Crawl Words form Shanbay
These simple codes crawl the studying words in Shanbay.com and format them into a csv file.  Since these codes are developed on the basis of detecting the html elements by js code, they are sensible to the network fluctuation and probably will be out of date soon .
### Demo
1. Go to the studying word page. Copy the js script to the console in explorer and run it.
2. Run the python code.

Then you get the formatted word list.
